# 21cmCAST

This package provides tools to perform Fisher fore**CAST**s from 21cmFAST outputs. It has been built on / complementarily to the [21cmFish](https://21cmfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package[^1]. A detailed example of how it works can be found in [**scripts/exec/fisher.ipynb**](./scripts/exec/fisher.ipynb). 

In order to work properly, the codes requires to have a working installation of
- [**21cmFAST**](https://21cmfast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [**21cmSense**](https://21cmsense.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
